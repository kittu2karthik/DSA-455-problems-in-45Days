# Welcome to my 455 problem challenge!

### Goal:

To solve 455 data structure and algorithm problems in 45 days.

To strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of core concepts.

### Structure:

This repository contains a folder for each day of the challenge, labeled Day 1 to Day 45.
Each folder contains the problem statements and my solutions for the problems solved on that day.
Solutions are written in C++

### Problem sourcing:

Primary source: Given link in the problem below

### Progress tracking:

I'll maintain a progress table in the Readme, indicating completed days and solved problems.
Consider visualizing progress with charts or graphs for extra motivation!
